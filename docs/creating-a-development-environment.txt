==================================
Creating a Development Environment
==================================

The following is our recommedation for creating an Arches environment that works well for developers. The first thing to consider is the general structure that will be in place, presumably all in the same directory:

+ ``/ENV`` - A virtual environment, we'll name it ``ENV``. This should be built from Python 2.7.x, and you should make sure pip is up-to-date. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

+ ``/arches`` - The local clone of your fork of the `archesproject/arches <https://github.com/archesproject/arches>`_ repo, which gets installed into your virtual environment. Often, this part of the code is referred to as "core Arches".

+ ``/my_project`` - The location of your Arches project. This is the app in which you will be making the majority of your front-end customizations (new images, new template contents, etc.).

+ ``/py_package`` - The location of your Arches package. Packages contain all of the custom database definitions that you will use. Resource Models, Branches, Concepts, Datatypes, Widgets, Functions, business data (resources for initial load)... these are all stored in a package. Packages are loaded into Projects via the command line.

Setting Everything Up
=====================

#. Make sure all dependencies are installed. You may also have external services in mind for some of the Arches dependencies, like a remote Postgres/Postgis or ElasticSearch installation. In that case you'll those credentials eventually, but not immediately. You'll also need ``git`` installed locally.

#. Make a new virtual environment built from Python 2.7.x and activate it.

    .. code-block:: bash

        virtualenv ENV
        source ENV/bin/activate

    or, to activate on Windows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ENV\Scripts\activate

#. Clone the `archesproject/arches <https://github.com/archesproject/arches>`_ repo. We recommend that you clone **your own fork** of the repo, but you can also clone the original repo if you don't plan to contribute code.

    .. code-block:: bash

        (ENV)$ git clone https://github.com/archesproject/arches.git

#. Link your local clone of the repo to ``ENV``. This is **instead of** using ``pip install arches`` which would install the pypi Arches distribution directly into ``ENV``. When you install the local clone, any code changes you make inside of ``/arches`` (like checking out a new ``git`` branch) will be immediately reflected in your runtime environment.

    .. code-block:: bash

        (ENV)$ cd arches
        (ENV)$ pip install -e . --no-binary :all:
        (ENV)$ pip install -r arches/install/requirements.txt
        (ENV)$ pip install -r arches/install/requirements_dev.txt
        (ENV)$ cd ..

#. Create the new project you will be working on. In this project you'll make all of the necessary changes to your templates, define all of your settings.py variables, run ``manage.py``, etc. This is also where all your ``yarn`` components will be installed.

    .. code-block:: bash

        (ENV)$ arches-project create my_project

    or on Windows::

        (ENV)\> ENV\Scripts\python.exe ENV\Scripts\arches-project create my_project

#. You can now enter your new project and create a package

    .. code-block:: bash

        (ENV)$ cd my_project
        (ENV)$ python manage.py packages -o create_package -d ../my_package

    on Windows remember to change the forward slashes to backward slashes.

----

You now have your development environment ready. It should look like::

    /Projects
        /env        # virtual environment, activate this but don't modify things inside of it
        /arches     # clone of your core Arches fork (git repo)
        /my_project # the project, where you store settings and from which you run manage.py_package (could be a git repo)
        /my_package # the package, where you should export your resource models, etc. so you can share them (could be a git repo)

Before proceeding, you should either alter the ``settings.py`` file in your project to give it your postgres/postgis credentials ``DATABASES['default']``, or add a ``settings_local.py`` file and put the credentials there to keep them out of version control (and, if you are on windows, you need ``GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = path/to/gdalxxx.dll``. Then get ElasticSearch running and you can run ``python manage.py packages -o setup_db``. Now you can run ``python manage.py runserver`` and view Arches in a browser.
