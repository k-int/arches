```

### Breaking changes
- The minimum supported version of Python is now 3.11.

- The minimum supported version of GDAL is now 2.4 (along with GEOS 3.8).

- The `TileModel` entity has been updated. Instead of `nodegroup` acting as a foreign key to the `Nodegroup` table, it has been replaced with `nodegroup_id`, a simple UUID field. There is now a `nodegroup` class method that will retrieve the Nodegroup from the `nodegroup_id` field, but any direct database references to `nodegroup` should be updated.

- Following a deprecation in 7.6.0, the `-o install` argument to `manage.py packages` has been removed.

- `ensure_userprofile_exists()` was removed from the `Tile` model.

- The following fields are no longer nullable. If you have custom SQL (or Python code that uses direct ORM operations to bypass model `save()`, etc.), you will need to set these fields directly on creation:
    - `Node.alias`
    - `TileModel.data`

- The following fields implemented [`related_name`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name) and [`related_query_name`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_query_name) to improve upon the Django-supplied defaults:
    - `NodeGroup.parentnodegroup`
    - `TileModel.parenttile`

    For instance, a tile query can prefetch its children with the more readable:
    ```
    TileModel.objects.filter(...).prefetch_related("children")
    ```

    Rather than:
    ```
    TileModel.objects.filter(...).prefetch_related("tilemodel_set")  # OLD NAME
    ```

    In the event you had ORM queries on these models using the defaults (`__nodegroup` or `__nodegroup_set` or `__tilemodel` or `__tilemodel_set`), make these changes:

    - From Nodegroup, traversing a child nodegroup: `nodegroup` -> `child`
    - From Nodegroup, collecting child nodegroups: `nodegroup_set` -> `children`
    - From TileModel, traversing a child tile: `tilemodel` -> `child`
    - From TileModel, collecting child tiles: `tilemodel_set` -> `children`


### Upgrading Arches

1. You must be upgraded to at least version   before proceeding. If you are on an earlier version, please refer to the upgrade process in the []()

### Upgrading an Arches project

1. Upgrade the `requires-python` value in pyproject.toml to `">=3.11"`.

1. Remove "3.10" from the `python-version` matrix in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

1. In settings.py, add the following key to `DATABASES` to [improve indexing performance](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/11382):
    ```
        "OPTIONS": {
            "options": "-c cursor_tuple_fraction=1",
        },
    ```

1. Update your frontend dependencies:
    ```
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

1. Within your project, with your Python 3 virtual environment activated run:
    ``` 
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Then run:
    ```
    python manage.py updateproject
    ```

3. Create editable_future_graphs for your Resource Models using the command `python manage.py graph create_editable_future_graphs`. This will publish new versions of each Graph.

4. Update your Graph publications and Resource instances to point to the newly published Graphs by running `python manage.py graph publish --update -ui`

1. Also consider running validation checks:
    ```
    python manage.py validate
    python manage.py validate --fix [error]
    ```

5. Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:
    ```
    python manage.py es reindex_database
    ```

6. Run `npm start` or `npm run build_development` to rebuild your static asset bundle:
    - If running your project in development:
    -  `npm start` will build the frontend of the application and then start a webpack development server
    - `npm run build_development` will build a development bundle for the frontend assests of the application -- this should complete in less than 2 minutes
    - If running your project in production:
    - `npm run build_production` This builds a production bundle. **takes up to 2hrs depending on resources**
    - Alternatively you can run `python manage.py build_production`. This will create a production bundle of frontend assessts and also call `collectstatic`.
